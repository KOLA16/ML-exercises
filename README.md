In this repository I will collect small ML/Data Science projects and course exercises. 

## Machine Learning by Stanford University (Coursera)

Programming assignments from the [ML_coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?). Original exercises were written in Octave, I have rewritten them using Python libraries such as: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
