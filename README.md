# ML-exercises

In this repository I will collect small ML/Data Science projects and course exercises. 

## Machine Learning by Stanford University (Coursera)
[ml_by_stanford_coursera](ml_by_stanford_coursera)

Programming assignments from the [ML_coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?). Original exercises were written in Octave, I have rewritten them using Python libraries such as: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera)
[deep_learning_specialization](deep_neural_network)

Exercises and deep learning models based on lectures and assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?)
